# Brain Health Principles

Brain health is not a feature — it is the constraint.

All Kinetic Intelligence systems adhere to the following principles:
- Defensive improvement over offensive amplification
- Reaction efficiency over raw aggression
- Longitudinal tracking over one-off metrics
- Evidence-based validation over anecdotal performance

If a metric cannot be justified neurologically, it is not shipped.
