# Architecture Overview

The Kinetic Intelligence Platform is designed as a modular system.

Each layer operates independently but feeds the next, allowing:
- Hardware evolution without software rewrites
- New applications without core redesign
- Scientific validation alongside commercial deployment

This separation is intentional and essential for safety, scalability, and trust.
