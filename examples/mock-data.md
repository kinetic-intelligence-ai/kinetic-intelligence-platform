# Mock Biomechanical Data

This document provides **illustrative examples** of biomechanical data structures used within the Kinetic Intelligence Platform.

All data shown here is **synthetic and non-representative**.

---

## Purpose

Mock data is used to:
- Demonstrate structure
- Enable visualisation examples
- Support interface discussions
- Avoid exposure of real user data

## Example (Conceptual)

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T10:32:15.234Z",
  "body_segment": "upper_torso",
  "force_level": 0.42,
  "direction": [0.12, -0.88, 0.45],
  "balance_state": "stable",
  "reaction_time_ms": 287
}
