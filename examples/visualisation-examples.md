# Visualisation Examples

This document describes **non-proprietary visualisation concepts** supported by the Kinetic Intelligence Platform.

Visualisations are intended to help humans understand biomechanical patterns without exposing raw data or inference logic.

---

## Example Visualisations

### Reaction Timing
Displays latency between stimulus and defensive movement initiation.

### Force Modulation
Shows how applied force varies over time rather than peak output alone.

### Balance and Stability
Illustrates centre-of-mass control and recovery following movement.

### Longitudinal Change
Compares performance and safety metrics across multiple sessions.

## Purpose

Visualisation is used to:
- Support coaching and rehabilitation decisions
- Communicate progress safely
- Aid clinical interpretation
- Avoid reduction to single “scores”

---

## Exclusions

This repository does not include:
- Rendering engines
- Charting code
- Model-driven inference outputs

Those components exist within controlled environments.
